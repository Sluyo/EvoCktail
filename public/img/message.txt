Another way to save money in transportation when you arrive at the apartment is to use UBER, you should download the apps (Apple, Android, and Windows) on your smartphone and request a driver to take you anywhere you want to go from the apartment/flat

You may take any of the transportation listed and Ask the driver to take you to 42 Street and 8 Avenue port authority and go to the ticket counter by the bathroom you will see gate # 51 and take the minibus. Or in one of the windows that said NJtransit you can buy a ticket for taking BUS 119, you must buy tickets in the at the ticket on the first floor you will take the bus in Gate #1. Take into consideration that the port authority is only about 5 miles from the apartment to try to negotiate with the taxi driver how much he may charge you to take you to the apartment. If the taxi driver will take you to the apartment, ask him to take the Lincoln Tunnel and exit at the first exit to Hoboken. Ask for the cost to 42 Street Manhattan and to the cost for the apartment and you made the educated judgment regarding the cost to pay for the transportation.
